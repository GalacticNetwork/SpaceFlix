    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>Our site, SpaceFlix, is a movie site based off the popular app Netflix. However, we are not attempting to outdo Netflix in any way. SpaceFlix is free for everyone, with movies that were previously not free now available at no cost. We hope you can understand our intentions, and we aim to keep our services free in the future. Nevertheless, we completely understand if we must take these movies down. If you have any problems, please email us, our email is <b><a href="mailto:albinusterrus@proton.me">albinusterrus@proton.me</a></b>. Thank you for
      your understanding.
      <!-- Is it? Like mailto: a proton email? Albinus: Yes, it is, mailto: is the same for all emails. -->
